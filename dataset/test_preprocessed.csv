193408,10831,524,5,09-11-2014,1,came here on a friday night after work with people there was a small line but the line moved fairly quickly didnt have to wait more than min tops we ordered the brisket spare ribs brontosaurus rib and the special pork cheeks for the sides we got the buttermilk broccoli with bacon and sweet potato casserole with maple and pecans for the free addons with the dish we got all of it cucumber celery red onions chiles for the meats if i had to pick only one favorite it would have been the brisket then the spare ribs then brontosaurus rib then the pork cheeks all the meats were extremely tender they all had lots of flavor and some pieces had quite a bit of fat in it the reason i liked the brisket the most was because i thought it had the most flavor to it for all the meats they sprinkle some sea salt which i thought made the meats taste better but at the same time it was almost overboard on the saltiness i loved the smokiness they were able to infuse into the spare ribs just my own personal preference but i hope they didnt use liquid smoke to get that flavor into it it was however really flavorful when i saw the worker bring out my order of the brontosaurus rib i did not know it would be that huge pictures does not do it justice you could easily share that with one other person and both of you would be full one issue is the cost for that rib it almost costs x as much as the other meat dishes but you dont really get x as much meat probably x compared to the others hard to say which is a better deal i feel like the brontosaurus rib lacks flavor when compared to the others the meat is very tender and they do an excellent job or keeping the juices in for that size of meat i was surprised that i could take all the meat off with just my fork i think the novelty of the size of the rib wears off quickly and youll some to your senses and order the other things the pork cheeks were very tender but very strong pork flavor if you dont like strong pork flavor i would not recommend this another thing about their meats is that there is quite a bit of fat in them obviously that makes it more tastyflavorful but sometimes it was uncomfortable eating a chunk of fat in my mouth for the sides i thought the buttermilk broccoli was just okay it really doesnt burst with flavor but it helps cut through the fat salt and sauce from the meats to me the sweet potato casserole tries to mimic southern candid yams instead of sugar they used maple syrup im sure both dishes use quite a bit of butter but the candid yams definitely uses more for the addons my favorite was the cucumber my least favorite was the cucumber because it was too pickled the chiles wasnt bad it just added spice but for me it didnt complement the rest of the food the cucumber was refreshing because of all the salt and sauce from the meats i am glad that they had something like that in addition the cole slaw helped a lot too i think those two sides helped cut the salt sauce and fat from the meats service service was excellent they help bring your food to your table because the seating is like cafeteria style you cant reserve your seat in advance unless you were already paying for your food at the cash register while we were eating a patron sat down at an empty table and one of the staff members came by and asked where was the rest of his party he said they were in line ordering but she said that he had to give the seat up because there were other parties ahead of him its understandable and fair as we finished out meal we wanted to take our bones home for our dog and the brontosaurus rib bone couldnt fit into their standard boxes so i explained the situation to one of the staff members and she went above and beyond she took the bone wrapped it in butcher paper then saran wrapped it thats attention to detail and service overall we thoroughly enjoyed this place the ambiance wasnt bad either not the most creative way but it works for them i only wish the prices were lower it is quite pricey here but we thought it was worth it and will definitely be coming back here again,0.598005994,0.229415143,0.123455113,0.8347272,1,0,0.2,1,0,0.511641276,0.409195053,0.2,0.918918919,0.096550179

187108,5120,508,4,06-02-2014,1,osteria morini is a fun and vibrant restaurant a bit more concerned with providing their guests an enjoyable evening rather than putting out flawless pasta the food here is fairly good the parmesan soup was really warm and satisfying on a particularly cold night and my girlfriend and i both agreed the tortellini inside were exceptional the pasta is heavy and not really in a good way if you gentle reader have been to marea you know michael white will often cut the richness and creaminess of his dishes with the use of seafood or a punchy red sauce that counterbalance was pretty absent on the two dishes we had the garganelli with truffle butter and the cappelletti with prosciutto while both of these dishes were very very tasty they were rich on an almost unappealing level and sitting in big pools of oil suffice it to say both my date and i did not feel totally awesome after downing these the dessert actually suffered from a similar overuse of oilcream and this was on a pretty objective level i had a chocolate hazelnut budino that was roughly creamegg yolk and chocolate and hazelnut the color of the actual budino was a whitish beige not so dissimilar from the whipped cream on top the little bites of pear in this was very inventive and refreshing but the dish was a disappointment in that there really was not much of a chocolate or hazelnut taste the room is really big and the seats are packed in but it is soho and seems like a pretty fun atmosphere the waiters are extremely attentive and very nice i really want to give this place stars but i just can not round down due to the fact that every single truffle dish had absolutely no truffle oil and actually only had real black truffle so word,0.461145841,0.034002842,0.083797365,0.348864994,1,1,0,0,0,0.11181374,0.256056649,0.105555556,1,0.047239369

179023,98871,484,4,17-02-2010,1,let me preface my review by saying if this place were in texas it wouldnt last a week i would give maybe three stars now that thats out there fette sau is fun relaxing and delicious i went on a thursday night around and it was packed not to worry it took only a few minutes to grab a seat at the bar and begin sampling their handful of really well picked delicious beers on draft they have a great whiskey collection too we tried a hudson that was stellar and apparently from new yorks first distillery since prohibition so informative bartenders give this place an extra half star we looked over the menu which was limited as bbq places usually are and ordered brisket pork shoulder and ribs the ribs were outstanding the brisket was a bit dry the thing that stuck out to me most about this place as compared to the texas joints are their weird bbq sauces let me tell you a good bbq sauce can make you forget that your brisket is dry my dining amigo loved one but he was from seattle what does he know but i found it way to vinegary when mixed with the thicker spicier one it was closer to the real thang but still not enough to make me forgive and forget its always crowded so dont go if youre looking for an intimate place to have a quiet conversation you are probably going to have to share a giant picnic table with people but hey thats fun i will go back to fette sau for two reasons the previously mentioned bar and the delicious broccoli thats right the broccoli ive never had broccoli melt in my mouth like this ive also never had broccoli at a bbq place but thats neither here nor there it was really garlicy and had some sort of chili flakes going on its the mustorder item,0.505678152,0.011260405,0.260355833,0.348068499,1,1,0,0,0,0.010060362,0.27842507,0.005555556,1,0.063669591

219650,31131,576,4,05-03-2014,1,i have been wanting to try this place since seeing it on the food channel i have to say the fact that they only source ingredients that are within miles of nyc did not stop them from creating such delicious items the place is rather small and is easily missed if you do not know the actual location or not trying to look for it personally like i was the ambiance is pretty nice especially combined with the waitress who was socially interactive especially for first timers in the place she easily pointed out her favorites and why she enjoyed them i had the winter pig however its better to get it with everything on it which means bacon and fried egg to add flavor and depth to the sandwich otherwise if it was sample plainly the apple chutney is rather overpowering as it gives a sour and sweet taste which is highly unusual and combined with either basil or rosemary there is an unique taste i felt it was complete when combined with a fried egg and bacon black trees beer selection is not to be trifle with as it is quite large and everything is local so it gives another chance to sample what new york has to offer or has been hiding they change their menus often depending on what is offered and when i visited it on friday it was quail and rabbit i was able to sample the loin and rabbit sliders which were pretty good especially when it was braised in some rabbit stock that made it soft and full of flavor black tree is definitely a place one has to visit just to see how a restaurant with its own prerogative to serve locally source ingredients can do wonders depending on the chefs own imagination and expertise one can only imagine what type of delicious dishes awaits as the seasons change and ingredients become available be sure to keep a lookout for black tree recommendation the winter pig w fried egg and bacon rabbit loin and sliders if it is still offered choose a beer i do not have a particular favorite yet so maybe next time,0.596793788,0.035271912,0.021458645,0.393468738,1,1,0,0,0,0.427996551,0.287248509,0.066666667,1,0.047664141

87579,58026,251,2,17-10-2014,1,first off let me preface this by saying my yelp grading criteria are as follows star would never go back unless paid to stars one time experience is enough stars average quality of foodambience stars great qualityserviceambience stars reserved for the best yelp reviews have been inflated with foodies thinking that food consist of average presentation and hip places to eat herd mentality me thinks is at work here and so i am here to say to foodies go take your herd mentality elsewhere this review is for those wanting the review of someone who believes that instagram photos of food says more about the individual taking the picture than the actual food peasants please stop reading others please continue service reservations were not made but we only waited minutes when arriving at pm on a thursday night the wait is made easier by the electronic system which sends a text when your table is ready so that you can walk around ev i will say though the hostess told me there would be a min wait and obviously severely overestimated the wait so dont be discouraged by the initial time quoted the waiters on the other hand were very nice but to tell you the truth many looked pretty casual ok you caught me they looked like west coast surfer bros and i come from newportlaguna beach territory so while this is normal for me i dont want these people giving me my food suggestions at the very least you can dress up and pretend you work at a restaurant charging a meal this is nyc not bro lets check out those swells food pork buns started off with this momofuku staple i would say less impressive than ippudos heavenly pork buns but a good experience overall this was probably the best part of the meal unfortunately the pork is tender and fatty while the sriacha like hotsauce adds and kick to the bun i love the fact the pork bun is simple with a hoison like sauce without the mayoheaviness accompanied with some pork buns totto chuwanmushi for those of you unfamiliar this is a traditional japanese egg custard usually steamed and served in a small tea cup this dish was served in a large bowl with mushrooms on top david chang the owner of the momofuku chain for those of your unfamiliar is korean by ethnicity but has lived in japan i believe if he tasted this dish even he would agree this is not authentic or even good by any standards bland tasteless and quite forgettable this oftentimes delicate dish was turned into a frankenlike fusion monstrosity quail wtf is this shit never had quail before but the presentation alone looked like a yr olds abstract painting watermelon radish great idea but then i would think the radish is somehow pickled in watermelon instead it just tastedlooked like it was cut up to look like miniature watermelons for you get one quail prepared by neanderthals cooked over a fire the meat was dry and bland take your money elsewhere honestly kinda looked like rat meat spicy pork sausage with rice cakes asked the waiter if this was good he said it was a favorite whenever i am told this by a waiter i ask but do you like it i trust waiters who eat the food often more than the people who dine only at a restuarant once in a while unfortunately in this case i was misled by both this is a korean like dish kimchi style sauce dressed on top of korean rice cakes that are pan fried sausages no where to be found more like ground pork put into the sauce extremely disappointed but very filling overall though i did not try to duck bo ssaam which i regret i do think that a great restaurant only needs dishes that are amazing that change seasonally all the dishes at momofuku tasted like a forced fusion of asianmodern american flavors and it fails miserably for me momofuku has been quite disappointing to say the least and i would think that for david chang having lived in tokyo there is some regret at not honoring the authenticity and culture behind the dishes he is trying to bring to nycs masses on the other hand go across the street to milk for some blueberries and cream cookies tastes like you are eating blueberry clouds,0.457195431,0.494591948,0.247046041,0.869374751,0,1,0.066666667,0,0,0,0.876858176,0,0,0.053416272

345282,21611,840,4,05-04-2013,1,on to the entrees we asked the waiter for his recommendations and he responded with the vaca frita and the quesadilla de el salvador i had been eyeing the vaca frita anyway so i decided to go for it with his blessing it was cuban skirt steak latin fried rice tomato escabeche avocado and fried eggs and oh man was it good the steak was tender and teeming with latin flavor the rice was a little dry but the escabeche tomatoes red onions lemon juice and parsley gave it a nice little kick the fried eggs were perfectly cooked with the yellow of the egg spilling out upon first cut which i also mixed in with the rice the girls got a cuban sandwich tortilla espanola and quesadillas de el salvador now the trick to the unlimited sangria is to eat slowly so everyone except me because i was so excited by the delicious food on my plate enjoyed their meals at a dignified pace everyone was happy with their food and we all vowed to come again soon especially since our bill came out to only each including tip what a deal to read the rest of my review check out my blog city lights and tasty bites citylightsandtastybites,0.494191162,0.017126755,0.225179954,0.230983672,1,1,0.066666667,0,0,0.026156942,0.193135511,0.033333333,1,0.064771948

247499,45628,906,4,03-06-2009,1,as soon as you walk in the door there is an open kitchen area to the left we were seated quickly because we arrived when they first opened on saturday it was hot outside and we just walked through two blocks of annoying waiters from italian restaurants trying to hassle us into eating at their establishments the interior is covered in dark wood cool clean smelling air an almost zen environment in comparison to little italy and the summer heat outside i am almost embarrassed to say that this is my first experience eating at a malaysian restaurant sure i have drooled and even cooked some dishes from rasamalaysiacom but have never been out to get the real thing therefore i do not know what is authentic or even what it is supposed to taste like hopefully i will move somewhere where i can sample this food more often in the near future and become an expert but for now i just know that it tastes great we were so thirsty that we ordered four specialty drinks ranging from the coconut juice was served in a talk gold glass with slices of coconut in coconut juice the malaysian tea was a red milk tea with a slight cocoa taste to it in the same style glass on ice my favorite was the lychee drink which was diluted lychee juice on ice with five canned lychee fruits it was very refreshing the last was the fresh coconut juice which is a peeled coconut with a hole drilled in the top enough to stick a straw in while the fresh coconut tasted amazing it created suction that took a bit of work for appetizers we ordered the roti telur which was an egg filled paratha with a curry chicken dipping sauce i felt that with the stuffing the pancake was too heavy and will definitely order the roti canai in the future the dish that i was looking forward to the most was actually the mee goreng because of my various online readings and photos of heavenly experiences eating mee goreng from food stall vendors however here it had a strong vinegar flavor but i did love the chewy consistency of the noodles i would love to try this dish at other places to see more variations the nasi lemak arrived on a leaf shaped platter i have seen many variations of this dish on actual leaves that you unfold and find your meal as a present must be nice the kitchen was nice enough to substitute beef rendang instead of the chicken curry for this dish the beef rendang was rich and filling with bite sized perfectly seasoned tender bits of stewed beef the pickled dried anchovy with onion relish tasted great and so did the mixed veggie pickles my favorite would have the be the coconut rice in the center though the flavor and chewy texture was to die for all of their vegetables dishes looked great from the descriptions so it was hard to choose just one i have always wanted to try shrimp paste and i love water spinach so we went for the kang kung belacan and were not disappointed i have only eaten water spinach at dim sum with garlic or oyster sauce but the shrimp paste gave it a better depth of flavor since it was meaty and slightly smoky all of their vegetable dishes looked great so we will definitely try more of those in the future like i said before this was just a small taste and hopefully i will learn about and sample more malaysian cuisine in the near future cash only and their menu is on their website penangusacom,0.434295191,0.047715339,0.161075649,0.694344883,1,0,0,0,0,0.515377982,0.26975967,0.116666667,0.818181818,0.055296434

55827,40800,134,3,11-05-2010,1,when i started living in nyc years ago i lived right across the street from yasuda and came here all the time once a week after having eaten in many sushi restaurants in japan i could def attest that yasudas quality was on par with many of the top places in japan sadly it seems that yasudas quality has deteriorated recently most notably this year there were several times this year when i got a piece of fish that tasted very fishy ive also noticed a higher than expected turnoverwhile restaurant turnover is completely normal i remember that i used to see new trainees working behind other sushi chefs rather than serving sushi up front as a sushi chef and were required to work for the chefs for much longer before being promoted now it seems that more and more of the faces that i see at the sushi counter are new the experience for me has changed perhaps because i miss walking into a restaurant and sitting in front of my favorite chefperhaps because the restaurant just feels very cold and corporate or perhaps the quality just isnt on par with what it once was,0.65690779,0.331277966,0.201140839,0.219036241,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.220771394,0,1,0.059226822

181972,4351,495,3,03-09-2014,1,despite the fact that queens is a hefty hike for me nowadays i still love visiting the borough because of the sheer culinary diversity thats offered within its borders id heard of taste good malaysian cuisine in several instances but it wasnt until recently that i was able to make a visit to the restaurant its not a destination spot in the traditional sense of the word the interior is pretty barebones and tables get turned over fairly quickly but as id yet to expand my knowledge of malaysian cuisine i was looking forward to making a trip here for dinner i left the ordering to my two other friends who had been here previously and in due time our menus were taken away and the plates started arriving from the kitchen first the roti canai an indianinfluenced dish that features a flatbread with a curry sauce on the side the version at taste good has one of the stretchier and denser albeit more oily iterations which makes pulling it apart and dipping it into the curry sauce an even more enjoyable activity we also got an order of the hainanese chicken a plate that im not typically fond of but is also another signature malaysian dish the white meat was very tender and the skin delightfully plump and chewy the flavor was overall on the milder end even when submerged in a chiliginger sauce so an extra helping of cilantro would have come in handy the disappointment of the night had to be the kari laksa one of the most lauded dishes at taste good this singaporean coconut curry noodle soup was impressive at first glance with an opaque redtinted broth and toppings of shrimp fried tofu chicken fish cakes and bean sprouts unfortunately it didnt carry through on taste thanks to the overabundance of coconut milk that had been added to the broth even the chewy perfectly cooked noodles couldnt save the laksa from the heaviness that overpowered any nuance in flavor it was slightly ameliorated by the sizzling bean curd a dish featuring blocks of panfried tofu served with a thick gravylike sauce cooked with ground pork shrimp carrots onions and scallions its a pretty monotonous dish in flavor in hindsight but the combination of all the savory ingredients was delicious especially when paired with a bowl of white rice i wonder if over time the intensity and quality in dishes at taste good has declined especially given the strong positive reviews from earlier years for the most part the meal was satisfactory although the highs and lows were across the board for those in the area its a viable lunch or dinner alternative especially given the reasonable prices id consider returning to try a different selection of dishes although given the lengthy trek it doesnt seem worth making a special trip out for,0.598738105,0.301570988,0.054597311,0.558144166,1,0,0,0,0,0.094854843,0.575740531,0.605555556,0.972727273,0.086469534

326501,5690,859,4,30-12-2010,1,yakitori is japanese grilled skewered chicken meat and offal it can also be broadened to include other meats and vegetables the entire experience is reminiscent of spanish tapas in that you order lots of different things and can easily share and try everything the rather small second floor eatery is apparently a favorite of thomas kellers eric riperts and anthony bourdains among others here is a run down of our selections and a few thoughts on each skin a favorite of many when its still attached to the bird why should it be any less good skewered and grilled it had a nice bit of char flavor crispy edges and softer interior between the folds i liked this but would have loved it even more if all of the skin was super crispy i would still order it next time and ps you feel less guilty if you share soft knee bone okay i went into this one pretty sure i wasnt going to like it i was told that it would be a strange texture and that i would have to chew it for a while before i could swallow the whole thing lets just say i chewed one piece briefly before i decided spitting it out into a napkin of course would be my best option not a fan gizzard this was my first encounter with gizzard as well i was okay with it thought the texture erred a bit on the chewy side along one edge but enjoyed the spicy and somewhat crisp texture of the pargrilled onion skewered alongside it it was a nice touch and made me feel a bit less weird about eating grilled gizzard would i order this again on my own probably not heart would you believe that the heart was one of my favorites well you should because its true i was a bit hesitant going into this one as well but to be honest i really loved the flavor of the heart the texture wasnt weird it was super meaty the grilled flavor was great and it was juicy tail to be honest i nibbled around the edges mostly i enjoyed the slightly salted charred flavor of the edges but the texture was a tad offputting thigh honestly im a white meat person but im gonna say these thighs were really good they were so juicy and tender perfectly simply seasoned and even the fat had a good texture i often find chicken fat to be chewy if it isnt super crisp but this fat was just fine by me japanese fried chicken this was also a popular choice i mean its fried chicken whats not to like this one is doused in a slightly sweet and tangy sauce and topped with sesame seeds so its not really crunchy anymore but the flavors are great this is also a safe bet if youre unsure of some of the less obvious options chicken meatball it looks nothing like a meatball it looks more like a kebab but i guess if you squished a raw meatball onto a skewer it would be a kebab right this baby was soooooo juicy and flavorful i wanted it all for myself it was better than any chicken meatball or chicken kebab ive ever had in my whole life it was juicier than i thought ground chicken had any right to be pork belly with scallions and mustard these were also skewered with onion a nice contrast of texture and flavor to the pork belly the pork belly itself was not meltinyourmouth tender but it was also grilled and not braised i accept that the texture would be a mixture of tender and slightly chewy along the fatty edge i liked it overall though enjoyed the grilled flavor in the meat and thought the scallions and ponzu were a good accompaniment the pork belly is also offered with lemon and mustard as an alternative tori dango these dumplings were another hit the chicken meatballs inside were juicy and delicious and the sticky rice on the exterior was a fun flavor and texture addition ive never had dumplings coated with rice instead of wrapped in dough but i would definitely order these again if you are afraid of offal these are a great option zucchini tempura these are stunning ive never had tempura like this before each thickly cut piece of zucchini was crusted with rice cracker bits it offered a nice flavor and a completely unique texture to each piece this plate was also served with some smoked salt for you to dip or top your zucchini tempura with it was delicious and a wonderful touch avocado and tuna salad with tobiko i loved this salad i could have singlehandedly eaten a vat of it it was a great balance of textures with the soft buttery avocado the fresh raw tuna chunks and the tiny little fish eggs popping in your mouth in between bites offering a glimpse of briny flavor amidst this perfectly dressed salad so fresh kyona salad this salad was good very unusual but good it had a slight fishiness from the teeny tiny fried baby sardines and a bit of tanginess from the cream cheese the poached egg was part of the dressing making this a truly unique salad unlike any ive had before i had seconds,0.566761572,0.019934604,0.120874643,0.994424532,1,1,0.066666667,0,0.041666667,0.532911756,0.463748184,0.138888889,1,0.073628917

145952,4655,416,4,25-12-2011,1,very good roquefort cheeseburger short review came here for a late lunch in dec the chargrilled roquefort cheeseburger is solid the bun imo is the best part but the beef is also great i think the blue cheese was a bit overpowering it is strange inconveniencing that they only serve the burger after pm on weekdays chicken liver toast is a must although not for those squeamish about chicken liver creme caramel dessert wasnt bad although not entirely essential value is reasonable prices are moderate service was good ambiance is charming but a bit cramped the acoustics are loud i dont feel its the most comfortable dining environment detailed review chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese shoestrings dish rating yelpcomuserlocalphot yelpcomuserlocalphot very good burger overall the burger bun is exceptional the beef patty and seasoning are very good i loved the thin shoestring fries i felt the roquefort blue cheese was a bit overpowering but then again im not the biggest fan of blue cheese in general when used as the only cheese in a burger the beef patty worked great here the meat is sourced from the excellent pat la frieda butcher i wasnt able to find out what meats were used from my otherwise very helpful and attentive waitress however i doing some research many have suspect its a blend of sirloin chuck and shortrib i think the meat is grilled i requested the burger be cooked rare and it seems to have come out that way pretty well the meat is consistently cooked rare and there is some nice char on the outside juice levels are at the lower end of moderate it doesnt flood with juices but the meat is very moist and i feel the juices certainly lend to some flavor the meat is overall moderately fatty flavorwise i didnt feel the beef itself had an explode in your mouth level of flavor i think the meat while very delicious worked great in a more subtle manner while having a very balanced level of seasoning its really something i best enjoyed while savored more slowly texture of the meat is moderately soft the meat has a nice chewier texture to it being neither mushy nor difficult to chew i wasnt a fan of the roquefort blue cheese on some levels it worked great it certainly was a very good cheese that i enjoyed even though blue isnt my typical favorite the cheese was melted very nicely into the patty almost forming something akin to a butter and lending the patty a more buttery texture some level of restraint was used in terms of the amount of cheese used and that is a good thing because the flavor of the cheese is quite powerful i felt the blue cheese was already a bit overpowering in flavor and was the my least favorite part of the burger if the meat was more robustly flavored or if there were less blue cheese or even a milder cheesecheese blend i think the balance in flavors of this burger would have been more effective for me then again this only reflect my bias against blue cheese and other may feel different depending on how they like the roquefort for me the burger worked best when i reduced a bit around a third of the blue cheese the bun is my favorite part its a brioche bun toasted on both ends with a prominent char its a sweeter brioche and the toasting gives it very prominent char that lends additional flavor to the overall burger of course char on the bread isnt quite the same as char on the meat but i feel it certainly helps a lot the bread is light and compresses well it holds the juices nicely without falling apart the dough is quite light moderately doughy inside the bread to protein ratio is fairly spot on eating the bread by itself is very enjoyable the chef does an excellent job with any dish that uses bread imo have enjoyed their chicken liver toast grilled cheese sandwich a lot in the past at times i felt as if the burger was also lacking in more sweet flavors to balance out the aggressive blue cheese i felt using a bit of ketchup also in restraint helped a lot portion size of the burger is about the same as other gourmet burgers but i felt is was quite heavy and filling shoestring fries are great the cut is very slim i understand this is also a preference but i enjoy mine that way seasoned slightly a tad too aggressive along with some rosemary herbs they were slightly greasy but not overwhelmingly so even though a generous portion was given i did not feel they were too heavy theyre served at a nicely hotter temperature i enjoyed them very much and had no trouble finishing it overall a very solid burger and its easy to understand why this is one of nys most acclaimed burgers recommend,0.4068359,0.061738667,0.294445199,0.970330546,1,1,0,0,0,0.385168152,0.925708411,0.088888889,1,0.042759563

254582,18124,662,3,16-02-2014,1,so been wanting to come here since my boyfriend and other friends have raved about it and i was excited to see that i was coming here for valentines day unfortunately it was a bit disappointing heres the breakdown service i heard the place dont usually take reservations on daily basis but i guess they took reservations for those who wanted to dine here for valentines day when we walked in we were seated right away it was a prefix menu that night so we only had a choice of drinks that night the meals were quicktoo quick that they were a bit anxious to take my plates away while i was still working on it so they can bring in the next plate i didnt like that they didnt ask how i was doing with my meals and only came over to pick up my plates food as a complimentary side before we get started with the meal they had this amazing bacon flavored popcorn seriously i would just come back for the popcorn then we had another complimentary goodie before we started our meal it was this shot of chilled artichoke soup and it was pretty delicious so our first course from the prefix was this raw yellowtail with bits of crispy ham and winter citrus this was by far my favorite dish of the night usually you taste the fishiness from the raw fishes when you do it sashimi style but this was melt in your mouth goodness the winter citrus complimented the yellowtail so nicely there was an avocado pure on it but i didnt really taste it but overall the flavors of this dish were so refreshing i wanted a second round the second course was a berkshire pork belly with little neck clams in a bacon broth honestly this dish had a weird combination i didnt think the pork balanced well with the little necks the third course was a hake with mussels in a coconut broth with matsutake mushrooms and bok choy the coconut broth was unique and complimented the dish well i wish the broth was much more stronger though but the matsutake was cooked perfectly and saved this last to soothe my palette the fourth course was a ny strip with beets and potatoes the hightlight of the dish was the smoked yogurt and red beets even though the steak was cooked medium rare it was not a good cut i didnt really enjoy it as much but smothering it with the smoked yogurt helped it the beets were refreshing the dessert was a black forest cake with dark chocolatecherries and cream of some sort the cake wasnt as moist this wouldnt be my dessert of choice if i had to choose so i was a bit disappointed but it helped a bit when they brought out the complimentary two chocolate dipped strawberries to finish off the meal nice touchnice touch ambiance it was a small in there but cozy setting it wasnt anything that really stood out to me overall i believe everyone deserves a second chance so i would definitely come back another time to try their tapa style dishes that my boyfriend and friends raved about,0.571393571,0.287606266,0.10783648,0.587614496,1,1,0.066666667,0,0,0.488646163,0.252826723,0.033333333,1,0.082231041

335731,5711,685,4,03-08-2013,1,i and the other people in my party agreed that umami burger was worth the hour wait just have someone from your party or everyone arrive hours earlier than you would like to eat put your name down and go to a nearby bar they text you a link to a website where you can check how many parties are ahead of you and the anticipated wait time easiest wait ever so everyone at our table tried the thin fries truffle fries tempura onion rings smushed potatoes the original umami burger and the truffle burger fries were nice and shoestring although i think i prefer spotted pigs truffle fries get soggy tempura onion rings lack the crunchy crispy onion ring fried battered shell that i love in onion rings smushed potatoes were just potatoessmushed the sauces they put out on the table are great especially the spicier ones however the umami ketchup is forgettable all in all ignore the appetizer menu unless youre starving and want something on the table as soon as possible now onto the burgers all the burgers are medium rare perfect and charred with a little u on top the burger sort of falls apart in your mouth crumbles away as my friends put it it literally melts in your mouth the original burger was good but there was a little bit too much tomato in my opinion the parmesan crisp was a nice touch the truffle burger amazing rich truffley nice salty finish definitely the groups favorite however i only had half of it and was told that having the whole thing is a little too rich burgers are a bit on the small side so if youre starving you can probably eat since we waited for so long and had some parties unfairly sat before us the hostess hooked us up with free desserts ice cream sandwiches from the good batch this dessert review will not be that great because it was kind of a blur at this point i was undergoing major food coma as i had just had a late brunch clinton st baking company hours before and combined with everything else i ate i wanted to die at this point we had the double chocolate peanut butter ice cream sandwich which sat between chocolate stroopwafels now ive long since been a fan of dutch stroopwafels and their crispy outsides and gooey sweet centers i dont think the stroopwafels in this sandwich contained the iconic gooey center of a classic stroopwafel these were more like plain chocolate wafers the second ice cream sandwich was paired between a chocolate chip cookie and something similar to momofukus compost cookie but in the classic style of umami was more salty that was delicious all in all easy wait meh appetizers great burgers good desserts but then again who makes bad ice cream sandwiches,0.480870464,0.023929572,0.136493277,0.544006372,1,0,0.133333333,1,0.041666667,0.177637252,0.217832146,0.1,0.947368421,0.0625

355379,9770,909,4,30-01-2012,1,this is not your everyday thai restaurant because they have their own styles first lets talk about the location located on th ave between th and th street i personally dont like going that way because the closes train only stop on th ave so if you want to go some where from th ave to th ave you have to do some walking and in the winter no fun lol but this restaurant is not that far you can take the blue line which is a c or e trains and stop at th street and walk few blocks to this restaurant if you not sure where to catch the blue line just take your train to times square stop and connected from there and im sure most of you your trains stop at times square i have a meeting with one of my friend for lunch and since i never been i have to looked around when i arrived in the area it was during day time and sunny and i gotta tell you once i arrived at the front of the restaurant i thought it was out of business lol because the sign of this restaurant not really stand out the front of the building is gray color and the name of the restaurant is chrome and is small if someone once told me about this restaurant and i happen to be in the area and i walk by i will never thought this is the same restaurant someone once told me unless you are going there because of this restaurant once i walked inside just like i told you before this is not your everyday thai restaurant beside the buddha sitting on the wall you will not have any idea this is a thai restaurant is very modern black and white is their color you see the bar on your right hand side tables and chairs on the left and it goes all the way through the end of the restaurant im thinking this place can probably held about for sit down dinner and standing maybe people probably good for christmas party they seated us kinda in the middle where the swanky chandelier and next to it is a table since im sitting on the left hand side facing the wall and the other table in the middle with chairs on each side facing each other thats mean one of the chair back is facing my back and is no walking space in between so every time someone walk by i have to move my chair and often people kicked my chair by accident very uncomfortable luckily is not busy during that time or else i will probably yell at someone for the food once again they have their own room service thai style i ordered the fried coconut calamari never have them before i had fried coconut shrimp but not the calamari i gotta tell you boyz and girlz you gotta try it when you decide to dine here it was sogood not only is was hot and crispy is also very tasty because they added the coconut in it so different my friend and i both ordered the pad thai i know right seem like thats all everybody order when they goes to the thai restaurant lol but not in this case because my friend and i read over the menu and they was writing on the bottom of the menu explaining how their pad thai are so different from the others and they called it the room service pad thai if you clicked on some of the pictures on here someone actually posted on here is seafood pah thai covering by egg white is very nice and is also tasted very good the presentation is really good and i like it a lot last but not least the server she came by and took our orders didnt say much never did stop by and check how we are doing and asking about how was the food etc my glass did almost went empty one time but someone else saw it and refilled for me overall stars i will recommend this to my friends thats for sure,0.391501255,0.069569997,0.189596632,0.724412585,1,1,0.066666667,0,0,0.230813452,0.338464243,0.038888889,1,0.048729482

349451,76348,247,5,13-04-2013,1,disclaimer i studied in japan for months i didnt eat ramen every day and i dont claim to be an expert but this does at least allow me to compare ramen to what i ate in its country of origin additionally a fun fact going out to eat by yourself in nyc drastically reduces your wait time i went to ippudo at pm monday night and only waited minutes to be seated the decor is definitely more modern but beneath that is an undercurrent of a ramen house there are booths along the sides and in the main space are large tables for people i sat with a number of strangers who were already engrossed in their meals the smell was great and the staff were all shouting in japanese as customers were seated you can see the cooks behind a counter working in teams to fill orders and i recommend taking a look if youre sitting nearby i was conflicted between trying a more traditional dish since this was my first time here or eating their bbq pork special luckily the special runs until june so i asked for the akamaru modern a pork bowl with miso paste with kakuni braised pork belly the meal far exceeded my expectations the broth was delicious without being too salty a common occurrence for ramen shops and common complaint from customers the pork was tender and flavorful and ordering the kakuni was clearly the right idea as i finished the main pork very quickly the noodles were light and soft without being mushy and the greens were amazing its the first time i wished thered been a few more greens in my ramen i planned ahead of time to eat the noodles quickly so i could get the second helping a call of kaedama will get you more noodles if you have enough broth remaining but it turns out i didnt need to plan at all while the broth was great i devoured my noodles quickly taking more time with the second serving and my remaining pork and veggies to enjoy it all with the soup final verdict i have some fond memories of eating ramen in japan i think most westerners who get to visit look forward to their first japanese ramen and built the experience up in their memories with that in mind i can easily say that ippudos ramen was as good and quite possibly better than the best ramen i had in japan as a caveat i couldnt use yelp at the time to find the best ramen in tokyo or osaka but i definitely believe ippudo ranks up there with the best of them i havent visited totto ramen or some of the other popular ramen places in nyc yet but if any somehow blow ippudo away ill revisit this review as long as i list this as stars know that ippudo remains king as far as my palate is concerned,0.565961053,0.24578034,1,0.532457188,1,1,0.4,1,0.041666667,0.078470825,0.298513459,0.022222222,1,0.090093645

4018,4802,490,4,18-06-2009,1,so the four months worth of deal activity whereby i was worked to within an inch of my sanity on numerous occasions was probably not a worthwhile tradeoff for the free lunch i got here but even for the tasting menu is really quite something we began with a chefs amuse of cauliflower mousse salmon roe truffle oil and tomato coulis before launching into the prix fixe selections starting with porcini flan dungeness crab and truffle oil the crab was layered delicately throughout but it was the truffle oil which really carried the flavor of this dish and subtlely cut the natural earthiness of the porcini for the seafood dish i opted for the skate with peas and if i recall roast garlic bouleys rendition had a perfect juiciness to it that made one of our diners secondguess every piece of skate he had thrown back into the water whenever he went fishing for the main dish i went with the cooperstown first of the season baby spring lamb which was served with a black mint puree roasted garlic shoots and hurley mountain chive fingerling potatee puree the latter two elements paired deliciously it took several bites of the lamb for the various flavor points to draw together but my lasting impression was one of thorougoing savoriness minus the mint puree which was strangely reminiscient of roast beets the menu promised coconut soup as a palletcleanser but instead and perhaps to our benefit we got the refreshing local strawberry and rhubarb parfait served with yogurst and raspberry sorbet and strawberry granite nothing cleanses the pallet quite like a sorbet of summer fruits and this dish more than did the trick for the dessert i chose the chocolate souffle which came paired with vanilla dark chocolate and coffee ice creams pedestrians as these flavours may sound the chocolate which may in fact have been vahlrona had to be the darkest id ever tasted in ice cream form while the vanilla tasted like it had been brought in fresh from madasgascar this morning as for the souffle itself well of course theres no way to eat a chocolate souffle without creating a huge mess bouleys variety does not distinguish itself in this regard but it was a profoundly decadent capstone to a flawless six course meal dessert comes accompanied with towers of petitfours macarons and other assorted french delicacies the interior is not for everyone it certainly wasnt for me you are greated whimsically at first with an anteroom bedecked with shelves full of apples fresh as an orchard this space evokes much of the terroir sensibilities you see carried out on the menu however the rest of the interior space just seems heavyhandedly baroque including the bathroom which people rant and rave about and tacky but this of course is a matter of taste and wont distract at all from the overall dining experience which certainly wasnt hurt by the fact that i didnt have to pay for any of it,0.690462244,0.083107942,0.121961157,0.600955795,1,1,0,0,0,0.278815752,0.354821213,0.05,1,0.066779716

229289,31302,603,5,14-02-2014,1,traif review this was my second visit to traif besides braving the weather again after going to the knave in the parker meridian for coffee and hot chocolate we were also venturing into brooklyn we took the m train and walked around the corner which in nice weather seems very fast but the rivers that the streets had become really made this more like fording creeks on the oregon trail after walking by shiksa and realizing their favorite waitress was working there that night we made our way to traif we started the evening with cocktails i had a red pearl or which is chili infused vodka muddled with thai basil kiwi and citrus sour one of the best drinks i have ever had my friend had the rude little pig which is lapsang infused tequila with orange liqueur pomegranate and a bacon rim i have had this before and for me the bacon rims tastes a little too much like artificial liquid smoke her boyfriend had the dacker adirondack ale which was great becca our waitress was phenomenal letting us order our plates a little at a time because we prefer having only at a time while we were waiting the staff greeted us with an amuse of the bacon broth i dont quite remember the order of dishes but we started with a few salads the macintosh pomegranate cranberries greens with bacon and blue cheese was light and delicate the cheese was grated into a fine dust instead of hunky which my friends boyfriend enjoyed we also has the tricolore salad with grapefruit clementines currants carbs al vino and sunflower seeds this was very bright and fresh but i think i preferred the first the burrata with roasted beets raspberries pomegranate yogurt and mint was my least favorite dish of the evening way too sweet it was like eating dessert burrata doesnt have enough salt to stand up to the sweetness of both beets and fruit eternally on the menu we had two orders of the spicy big eyed tuna tartare on top of little tempura japanese eggplant rounds with kecap manis still one of my favorites it warrants saying that my friend is picky about meat products due to animal rights so many of the dishes are off limits we did get to have the braised escargot with pork sausage roasted wine mushrooms in a red wine sauce that came with two thick toasts for sopping up the sauce she did not try the snail but it was her boyfriends first time so i bullied them into ordering it could have been a little more flavorful but it was nice and light which escargot dont have s a tendency to be due to the butter that people use with them the salt and pepper shrimp with pineapple roasted yam snow peas and sweet spicy thai vin were another highlight of the meal so much better than the shrimp at abc cocina sadly most of the other pork duck foie gras beef sweetbreads dishes were off limits for ordering but i saw them all go by and i really wanted one of everything supposedly the last menu at traif was even better although i wasnt a proponent of ordering it the baked muenster cheese with smoked chorizo golden apples and crostini was another stand out dish of the evening perhaps another bite of apple or crostino would have helped the amount of cheese but it was not excessive being served only in a small ramekin our final two dishes included the sauted broccoli rabe with portobello mushrooms truffle toast fried egg and aged asiago and skate cheeks new england chowder braised bacon spinach potato and leeks the egg on the broccoli rabe would have been better if we had eaten it right away but it over cooked and became hard boiled i partially blame my friend who turned it over so it would drain into the bread but didnt pierce it enough not at good as i remember the skate cheeks were like a chowder but large pieces instead of incorporated buttery texture and a nice light taste they were another highlight for me we decided to order the bacon doughnuts because we thought they only came two to an order they brought us four along with panda cotta on the house and sweet vermouth after dinner drinks another fabulous meal i specifically complemented becca on her impeccable service aside from the little freebies they also bring a piece of pineapple to refresh you at the end they were wonderful and attentive water always in the glass and the drinks just kept coming by request of course,0.722584249,0.165793627,0.196387342,0.874153724,1,1,0,0,0.041666667,0,0.652671756,0.005555556,1,0.113839286

48705,2357,118,3,11-11-2013,1,after reading all these wonderful reviews and food blog posts on piora perhaps i hyped it up too much for myself because i left feeling for the most part rather unimpressed i made a reservation on opentable almost a month in advance in order to get a table that wasnt at either pm or pm my friend and i ended up coming for dinner at pm on a monday night veterans day and i immediately liked the rustic yet modern feel of the restaurant there are a few tables and counters by the door a hallway that stretches along the bar and the main dining area in the back we were seated in the back along the wall and i absolutely loved the view out the back window of a very vibrant looking garden to start we were presented with an amusebouche sunchoke chips with mustard and violet interesting combination and i thought it was delicious from the menu my friend and i ordered the monkey bread and the scallop to share as appetizers the monkey bread was every bit as wonderful as i had read and well worth the it came out of the kitchen piping hot and the bread was soft and doughy it was presented with whipped lardo and seaweed butter on the side the lardo basically tasted like a fluffy halfmelted butter and it was delicious with the bread the seaweed butter was a novel idea and i enjoyed that as well the scallop came out soon after our monkey bread the dish consisted of three scallops presented nicely with sweet corn a creamy sauce chanterelles and crispy chicken skin i thought the scallops were seared well but not particularly memorable the sweet corn was better and the chanterelles were as my friend put it divine and had a wonderfully rich flavor i ordered the bucatini as my next course and this is where my impression started to go downhill the bucatini served with garlic dungeness crab maitake mushrooms scallions and slivers of red pepper tasted vaguely like lo mein and i enjoyed the first few bites i did find it on the salty side though as i started to finish off the noodles and reach the bottom of the bowl it started to get oilier and oilier until i was left trying to get the last few pieces of crab and mushroom from the very oily sauce at the bottom my friend had the rigatoni which he also found very oily additionally he had ordered a side of spigarello which our server described as similar to kale and broccoli rabe it was so incredibly salty that neither of us could finish it which made us both very sad because we really wanted to eat it oversalted food aside it was clear that piora was trying hard to make a good impression through the level of their service our servers were incredibly attentive our orders were taken and our plates cleared promptly the table was scraped of crumbs after each course and we received helpful answers to our questions unfortunately and i almost feel bad saying this because everyone there was so nice the level of food just wasnt as good as i had expected and neither my friend nor i are particularly eager to go back soon,0.546504428,0.2748955,0.020507945,0.612504978,1,0,0.066666667,0,0,0.257832711,0.34760446,0.127777778,0.958333333,0.041087963
26117,21738,72,2,28-12-2012,1,honestly this place is all hype people think that the long line means its amazing and exclusive but its so not worth waiting more than an hour for a bowl of noodles that is decent but not in any way remarkable i actually thought the noodles were underdone and yes im familiar with the japanese style of noodle which tends to be cooked firmer but theres a difference between that al dente ramen style and being undercooked the chashu was fat which is far from the ideal meatfat ratio the miso broth was good but lacked that signature dimension of saltiness i could taste more of the sweet alcoholic fermentation of the miso and not the prominent salty note thats typical of miso ramen i understand that the kitchen was probably trying for a more refined version of miso than the typical salt bomb but i think they missed the mark a bit here minus points also for their menma which had a weird indescribable aftertaste and their rough diagonal cuts of scallions which just looks sloppy bean sprouts seem to be in every bowl and for me that is the mark of cheap filler sorry totto you need refinement,0.510058434,0.521588829,0.405269591,0.227598566,0,1,0.066666667,0,0,0,0.229409401,0,0,0.063653484

21348,18292,63,5,10-07-2013,1,ive been here a few times and most of those times required a minute to hour wait i went here on july for brunch knowing that id be waiting quite a while for a table for two i saw a couple walk out of the restaurant warning us that the wait was too long another couple in front of us asking for a table for two decided they didnt want to wait either after they were told hold long itd take to get a seat so then it was our turn to ask for a table for two and they responded the wait is a little long right now at minutes twenty five minutes thats nothing wow the people who opted to leave either are not from new york or theyre just darn impatient dont they know that walking to another lessthanspectacular restaurant and getting a table there will probably take at least minutes after four minutes of waiting another couple walks in and asks for a table for two they are told it will be a minute wait but they are also impatient and leave thirty seconds later we get our table a total wait of four and a half minutes as we sit down the table next to us is cleared and could have sat the impatient couple immediately a shame for them they could have had the most amazing brunch of their life,0.495092749,0.281972442,0.263887003,0.248108323,1,1,0.133333333,1,0,0,0.250100442,0,1,0.086829502

217638,33438,566,4,09-02-2011,1,i heard about this place from a somewhat unlikely source one of my fiances professors apparently he comes here all the time and loves it cant say i blame him either to start we got the red white and blue special which as every one here says is a great great deal i dont drink so she got a glass of the white and we shared the oysters which were fresh as can be plump seriously two were as long as my hand and briny and just delicious we also got the angels on horseback because honestly why wouldnt you if you like oysters and you like bacon youll like these and if you dont like oysters or bacon get that looked at cause theres something wrong so yeah that app is raw oysters wrapped in bacon with a cocktail sauce on top absolutely divine the salty bacon with the fresh sweet oyster and the spicy cocktail sauce it has everything for the entree i had the fish and chips and a bowl of the lobster bisque she had a pan roasted snapper with bbq shrimp and cheddar grits first the portions are big which is nice second the food is top notch which is better my fish and chips was the best i have had yet the batter was light and crispy the fish flaky and tender and the tartar sauce was really good it was sweet and tangy and i think as does my fiance that they put a little apple in it to give it the sweet the fries were also very good im not one to rave about fries but as far as they go these were nice and crispy outside and smooth and fluffy inside so yeah just right her fish was perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned the grits were great the shrimp though kinda lacked they were maybe a little over done and their bbq sauce wasnt that great but that was the only misstep of the night service was great always checking in just to make sure things were okay and clearing as things were finished its a bit cramped inside but despite that it was still very comfortable which cant always be said for small restaurants will i come back here you bet i will and well probably get two rwb specials this time,0.475247225,0.026801333,0.131060709,0.411190761,1,1,0,0,0,0.379131934,0.194946654,0.044444444,1,0.063946759
