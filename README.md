# A Deep Learning Approach for Fake Review Detection

This project explores a **Deep Learning-based approach to detecting fake and genuine reviews** using a **hybrid BERTâ€“LSTM model**.  
The goal is to build a reliable text classification system capable of identifying deceptive or spam reviews across various platforms.  
By combining **contextual embeddings** from BERT with the **sequential learning power** of LSTM, the model aims to achieve higher accuracy and generalization in fake review detection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop a model that can:
- Classify reviews as **fake** or **genuine** based on textual patterns.  
- Utilize **transfer learning** from BERT for semantic understanding.  
- Improve classification accuracy using a **hybrid deep learning architecture**.

## ðŸ§© Methodology

The project follows the following framework:

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Collected review datasets from Kaggle and other open sources.  
   - Included a balanced set of real and fake reviews.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).  
   - Tokenization and padding for sequence uniformity.  
   - Label encoding for binary classification.

3. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Generated contextual word embeddings using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**.  
   - Passed embeddings into an **LSTM** layer for sequential context learning.

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Combined BERT and LSTM layers in a hybrid architecture.  
   - Used **Dense** layers with **sigmoid activation** for binary output.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confidence.  
   - Visualization of training curves and performance metrics.
